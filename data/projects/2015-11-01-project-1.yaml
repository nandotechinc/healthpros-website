description: Since the early 1980s, when people with diabetes were introduced to blood glucose monitoring, they have been using their fingers to obtain blood samples. The fingers became the accepted source for blood for nearly two decades. As increasing numbers of people with diabetes started to manage their diabetes intensively, doing upwards of four to six blood checks per day, a need arose to be able to use alternate sites for blood samples. This need gave rise to manufacturers developing monitors that were accurate and approved for alternate sites.

description: We have partnered with Divvy Dose, a full-service pharmacy that delivers your pills in pre-sorted packs at no extra cost.  For patients on four or more medications, you can receive a personalized roll of pre-sorted medications, with clearly marked dates and times. Divvy Dose’s convenient dose delivery system ensures you take the right pill at the right time, every time.  DivvyDose accepts most insurance plans and your copays remain about the same as your regular retail pharmacy. Delivery is always free and they ship your medications direct to your door each month.

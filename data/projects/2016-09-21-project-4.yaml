description: We provide pain relieving braces custom fit for each individual patient's foot, ankle, knee, back, wrist or elbow (or any combination thereof). The knee is the most common type of problem that we see. People use braces in conjunction with post-injury therapy. They can also be helpful for active individuals who want to protect this joint from injuries.  Back braces are also very commonly prescribed; as bending over to tie your shoes can result in a back injury if youâ€™re not careful. These types of injuries can require a brace to help the body heal. Other back injuries that require a brace include chronic pain, strains, and posture issues such as scoliosis. Braces can also be helpful for people who need lumbar support or suffer from back pain due to pregnancy.
